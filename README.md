R2 Score
R2 Score is another metric to evaluate performance of a regression model. It is also called coefficient of determination. It gives us an idea of goodness of fit for the linear regression models. It indicates the percentage of variance that is explained by the model.

Mathematically,

R2 Score = Explained Variation/Total Variation
# PROJECT SUMMARY:
---

> In this project, we have a dataset containing data of scores obtained by students and there respective no. of hours of study.

> On Linear Regression Analysis of Data, we have observed that the coefficient of Determination is 97.74% which shows high relation between Independent and Dependent variable.

> In business decisions, the benchmark for the R2 score value is 0.7. It means if R2 score value >= 0.7, then the model is good enough to deploy on unseen data whereas if R2 score value < 0.7, then the model is not good enough to deploy. Our R2 score value has been found to be .9774. It means that this model explains 97.74 % of the variance in our dependent variable. So, the R2 score value confirms that the model is good enough to deploy because it does provide good fit to the data.
